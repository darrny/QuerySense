# QuerySense 🔍

**QuerySense** is an interactive web application that takes in CSV files, accepts queries in natural language, and provides insightful feedback about the data. It also offers the ability to generate visual representations of the data, making it easier for users to understand complex datasets through visualizations and AI-powered analysis.

## Features ✨

- Upload CSV files to analyze
- Natural language query support to ask questions about the data
- AI-generated feedback on the data, including summaries and insights
- Interactive visualizations (charts and graphs) to represent the data
- Clean, user-friendly interface for seamless interaction
- Instant query processing with real-time feedback
- Supports various types of visualizations using `Recharts`

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Upload CSV File**:
   - Upload your CSV file to the app interface
   - The app processes the data, making it ready for querying

2. **Ask a Query**:
   - Type your query in natural language (e.g., "What is the average salary?")
   - The AI interprets the query and analyzes the dataset to provide relevant feedback

3. **View Results**:
   - Get textual insights and summaries based on the data
   - Visualize the data using interactive charts and graphs generated by `Recharts`
   - Feedback is tailored to the data, with AI summarizing key points

## Technologies Used 🛠️

### Frontend Architecture
- **Next.js 13+** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **TailwindCSS** for responsive and clean UI design
- **React** components for modular and maintainable code structure

### Data Processing & Visualization
- **PapaParse** for efficient CSV file parsing
- **Recharts** for interactive and responsive data visualizations
- Custom algorithms for data distribution analysis and chart type selection

### AI Integration
- **Google's Gemini Pro** for natural language processing and data analysis
- Custom prompt engineering for consistent and relevant responses

## Technical Challenges Faced 😔
1. **AI Response Formatting**: Ensuring consistent formatting of AI responses for proper display
2. **Chart Responsiveness**: Maintaining chart clarity across different screen sizes
3. **Data Type Detection**: Accurately detecting and handling various data types for visualization
4. **Performance Optimization**: Managing large datasets without impacting user experience

### Future Improvements
- Support for additional file formats (Excel, JSON, etc.)
- Advanced data filtering capabilities
- Custom visualization options
- Data export functionality
- Session management for analysis history
